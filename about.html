        <div class="about-info">
            <p>Our company was formed in 2012 and has been operating in the used car parts business for over 10 years.</p>

            <p>We have been working with the largest suppliers of secondhand car parts in the UK and are part of the VRA. We were exporting car parts mainly to Eastern Europe and developed a strong network of reliable used car parts suppliers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Moreover, we expanded to Ireland in 2021.</p>

            <p>In 2022, the decision was made to set up our own operations in England, UK and we agreed to take on a lease of the fully licensed car breaking yard in Oldham, Lancashire, UK. This has enabled us to expand our list of buyers significantly and we now export not only to Eastern Europe but to the rest of the world.</p>

            <p>We operate from an Authorised Treatment Facility for End of Life Vehicles based at Auto Salvage International Limited, Salvage yard, Broadbent Road, Oldham, Lancashire, OL1 4HY which enables us to purchase various vehicles for breaking on a daily basis. Vehicles, such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Vauxhall, Peugeot, Citroen and many others. We buy scrap cars for dismantling and offer the best prices in Oldham and surrounding areas.</p>
